# Deploy WellnessConnect On Hostinger

This project deploys as two subdomains under `khajamynuddin.com`:

- Frontend: `https://wellness.khajamynuddin.com`
- Backend API: `https://api-wellness.khajamynuddin.com/api/v1`

## Hostinger Folder Layout

```text
public_html/
  wellness/
  api-wellness/
    public/
```

Set the subdomain document roots to:

```text
wellness.khajamynuddin.com      -> public_html/wellness
api-wellness.khajamynuddin.com  -> public_html/api-wellness/public
```

## Frontend Build And Upload

Build the React app with the production API URL:

```powershell
$env:VITE_API_URL="https://api-wellness.khajamynuddin.com/api/v1"
$env:VITE_DEMO_MODE="false"
npm.cmd run build
```

Upload the contents of `dist/` into:

```text
public_html/wellness/
```

Also upload:

```text
deploy/wellness/.htaccess -> public_html/wellness/.htaccess
```

The `.htaccess` file keeps React Router deep links working when users refresh routes such as `/get-started`, `/login`, or `/client/intake`.

## Backend Upload

Upload the Laravel backend folder contents into:

```text
public_html/api-wellness/
```

The API subdomain must point to:

```text
public_html/api-wellness/public
```

Create the production backend env file from:

```text
backend/.env.production.example
```

Save it on Hostinger as:

```text
public_html/api-wellness/.env
```

Update the database and mail values before running the app.

## Backend Commands

If Hostinger terminal access is available, run these from `public_html/api-wellness`:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan storage:link
```

If dependencies are installed locally instead, upload the `vendor/` directory with the backend.

## Android / Capacitor

Use the same API URL for Android builds:

```powershell
$env:VITE_API_URL="https://api-wellness.khajamynuddin.com/api/v1"
$env:VITE_DEMO_MODE="false"
npm.cmd run build:cap
npx cap sync android
```

## Smoke Tests

After upload, test:

- `https://wellness.khajamynuddin.com`
- `https://wellness.khajamynuddin.com/get-started`
- `https://wellness.khajamynuddin.com/login`
- `https://wellness.khajamynuddin.com/client/intake`
- `https://api-wellness.khajamynuddin.com/api/v1/auth/login`
- `https://api-wellness.khajamynuddin.com/api/v1/auth/register`

The API login/register endpoints should return JSON responses, even for validation errors.
